	Explanations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	*****************
	OBJECTS
	*****************
	
	A MS3 Object is in two parts: the first part contains the set of
	attributes (for example a 'WINDOW' will contain the following
	attributes: title, x, y, width, height etc).
	the second part contains the 'handler', which controls the
	changing of the attributes values, the creation of new object
	or its deletion, an object opening or its closing, on object
	attributes value request.
	
	These are the obect operators:
	
	* OPEN
	
	opens an object ( object must already exist )
	
	* CLOSE
	
	closes an object ( object will not be deleted )
	
	* CREATE
	
	creates a new object ( object did not exist )
	
	* DELETE
	
	object will be deleted
	
	and more there is another 'handler': it is the ASK handler 
	which does not have reserved word for its work but just an 
	'access syntax':
	VARIABLE = objectvar(attributename);
	
	for example:
	titolo = mywindow (title);
	
	*****************
	VARIABLES
	*****************
	
	Variable definitions used in the MS3 language are:
	
	byte		: a 8-bit variable size, integer
	word		: a 16-bit variable size, integer
	long		: a 32-bit variable size, integer
	string		: defines a pointer to a string
	number		: a 32-bit variable size, either integer or floating
	float		: a 32-bit variable size, floating
	double		: a 64-bit variable size, floating
	struct/structure: a 'structure' variable, similar to a 'C' one
	** STREAM **	: not used in 1st realese, it is a dynamic size struct.
	unsigned	: the next definition variable is without sign!
	signed		: the variable is signed ( as normally happens )
	pointer		: it explains that the object is just a pointer
			: to the described variable
	
	
	Examples:
	
	pointer unsigned long umberto;
	
	 stands for a pointer ( 32-bit sized object ) for a variable size 32 bits
	 and without any sign!
	
	pointer long big[1000];
	
	 stands for a pointer to vector of 1000 32-bit size objects.

	FUNCTIONS
	*****************
	
	Functions are external routines than can be inserted in a MS3 program
	kinds of functions for Amiga are:
	
	1. The library calls
	   They are pieces of libraries, that can be called by a lot of tasks
	   simultaneously.
	
	2. Binary functions
	   They are pieces of raw machine language.
	
	3. Interrupt functions.
	   This kind of functions are used only by the 86 family of processors.
	
	all functions can not be included directly on a MS3 program file.
	
	*****************
	LOOPS
	*****************
	
	They are different kinds of loop that can be used:
	They are:
	
		do
		
		
		while (_ _ _ loop checker _ _ _);
		( loop with final control )
		
		
		
		while (_ _ _ loop checker _ _ _);
		
		
		close while; / wend;
		( loop with initial control )
