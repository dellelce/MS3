An MS3 object is composed of a set of 'attributes', which are meant to represent
all natural objects, under the MS3 language there are different actions that can
be effected $onto an object, {an object for example can be 'opened', i.e. make
known to the program, it is used}
They are:

- open
	
	gets the 'knowledgement' of the object, after 'opening' the object you
	will be able to ask about its attributes values, modify them, or just
	kill it

- create
	
	creates a new object, the object did not exist or if existed, it will be
	replaced by the new object ($according to the handler).
	
- modify
	
	permits you to change an object attribute (usually more attributes are
	modified at same time)
	
- close
	
	closes an object, the object is no more available and it can be modified
	and neither it can be asked its attributes status
	
- delete
	
	object just no longer exists
	
- ask
	permits you to know an attribute value; this is atypical compared to
	others, it has another form:
		objname (attribute name) {currently it is being changed to
					the object.attributename form....
