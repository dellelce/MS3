The MS3 compilere $divides strings in 2 kinds: work and program ones.

work strings are: variables names, actions', functions', etc..

program strings are: all that strings that will end up in the executable file.
Usually all program strings $(are between) $apici.

For example the MS3 expression:

jerry = "My life won't end this way!";

has both kinds of strings:
'jerry', the variable name, is a work string.
"My life won't end this way!", is a program string, since
it will end up in the executable file.
